The trooper

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back

The bugle sounds the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death

Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh 

The Horse He Sweats With Fear We Break To Run 
The Mighty Roar Of The Russian Guns 
And As We Race Toward The Human Wall 
The Screams Of Pain As My Comrades Fall 

We Hurdle Bodies That Lay On The Ground 
And The Russians Fire Another Round 
We Get So Near Yet So Far Away 
We Won't Live To Fight Another Day 

Ooooooooh
Ooooooooh
